# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT *
FROM spotifydata
;

--What are the top 10 songs based on danceability?

SELECT spotifydata.track_name, spotifydata.danceability
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY spotifydata.danceability desc
LIMIT 10
;


--What were the three shortest songs released and who released them?

SELECT spotifydata.artist_name, spotifydata.duration_ms
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY spotifydata.duration_ms asc
LIMIT 3
;

-- Which artists have a popularity score above the overall average popularity?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity) AS artist_popularity
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING MAX(popularity) > (SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM spotifydata)
ORDER BY popularity desc
;
